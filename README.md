RecipeApp

Description
This is a command line application written in C# and Visual Studio that allows a user to enter and manipulate recipe details. The user can input the ingredients, quantities, units of measurement, and steps for a single recipe. The application will display the full recipe in a neat format, allow the user to scale the recipe by a factor of 0.5, 2, or 3, reset the quantities to the original values, and clear all data to enter a new recipe. The data is stored in memory while the application is running and is not persisted between runs.
